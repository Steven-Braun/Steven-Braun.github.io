The web application Brain Food was conceived by a group of Computer Science students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, with the idea of promoting healthy food recipes to University of Hawaii students. It’s no surprise that college students have difficulty getting proper nutrition with an empty wallet, it’s so tempting to go to Mcdonald’s dollar menu rather than spending a $5 on a salad. But with an assignment peering around the corner at all times, it’s absolutely essential that students be eating properly to maintain a healthy state of mind and body when dealing with such stressful circumstances. Brain Food understands the common student’s nutritional dilemma, and hopes to level up student’s nutritional habits by offering a database where users can add and look for healthy and affordable recipes, as well as locations where to buy ingredients necessary.
