## Easy, Breezy, Beautiful, GitHub

Configuration’s primordial essence is the Latin words “com,” meaning together, and “figurare,” meaning to form. Putting those together we have the definition, to arrange and/or organize, . Having apt skills in configuration management is a quintessential requirement for being a good software engineer. When it comes to working in teams or in a large group, trying to build astronomically large and complex software systems is a hassle, Even moreso without proper configuration management, making these convoluted systems even harder to maintain over time. Luckily for us software engineers, there are repositories such as Github, which is the most popular technology for configuration management. Git and Github go hand in hand together, as Git is a version control system, Github is the hosting site that allows one to push their git projects to, and make our software managing lives much easier. 

## Experience

When it comes to my own experiences with configuration management in general, I have had no real experiences with it. When I worked in teams, for example my Concentration project, I never had to deal with a large amount of files with a profusion of other people. It was just me and my friends crowded around a computer screen until we got the program to work properly. So I can’t really I’ve had problem with configuration management, but I can totally see how people could have problems with poor configuration management, causing massive backlogs for other people and cause the whole project to turn into a train wreck. 

## Git or Github?

I am not very well versed with configuration management or programs that are made to help with configuration management. When it comes to Git and Github, I feel like Git is popular due to Github, not the other way around. I like the way that Github feels, everything is easy to find, locate, and change whenever I want. Even the desktop app is pretty aesthetically pleasing and easy to use and commit to the master branch easily. Since I’m not really experienced with other version control systems, I wasn’t very comfortable using Git and was a little confused at times. Although I’m sure there are a lot of worse version control systems, I don’t quite think that Git is the reason that GitHub is so popular, and as a matter of fact, is the other way around.

## Conclusion

Conclusively, Configuration management is an important fundamental to learn when working in the software engineering field. Allowing ease of access to all folders/files that one or his colleagues might need while working on a project. All stored in an easy to locate place, allowing anyone with permission access to change or look over said files, and without configuration management programs, working on a project could get real messy. And Git is popular because the ease of access and simplicity of GitHub, making it the most popular technology for configuration management!
